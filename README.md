# 🛒 AI Grocery Recommendation System 🤖

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Grocery Recommendation System** is a web-based intelligent application that recommends grocery items to users based on their selected products.  
The system uses a **Machine Learning approach** to find similar and complementary grocery items and suggest them in real-time through a web interface.

This project combines:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Machine Learning)**
- **Python Flask (Backend API)**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend UI)**

The goal is to simulate a **smart shopping assistant** that helps users discover related grocery items such as bread, milk, eggs, fruits, and snacks.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Used

### 🔹 Model Name: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, which is a **supervised learning model** based on similarity measurement.

## 🧠 Why KNN is Used in This Project

KNN is selected because:

- It works well for **recommendation systems**
- No complex training phase is required
- Easy to understand and explain
- Suitable for small to medium datasets
- Gives instant results based on similarity

KNN finds products that are **most similar** to the user's selected grocery items.

## ⚙️ How the KNN Model Works in This Project

### Step 1: Product Data Representation

Each grocery product is stored with numerical features such as:

- Price
- Rating
- Popularity
- Category (encoded numerically)
